# AI-Music-Neuroscience

Project Overview: 
This project studies how AI-generated music affects brain activity. EEG data is recorded and analyzed in EEGLAB to extract features like Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Gamma waves. These patterns are compared with AI music from Suno to explore links between brain responses and musical characteristics.
